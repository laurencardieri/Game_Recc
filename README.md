## Project Overview 

This project develops a machine learning algorithm to recommend a game to someone, based on their mood, their desired gaming-style, and how old the wish for the game to be.  
This application then used OpenAI to give a short desciption of the game and explain why it was chosen for the user. 


The moods and gaming-styles were based of the different types of genres provided in the dataset.

## Dataset 

All data was collected with an API for the RAWG Video Games Database. The A.I. is provided through an API key from OpenAI.
